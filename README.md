# lissajous
Basic angle generation in Matlab and Python using 3D Lisssajous figures. Includes:
- Matlab file to generate static and dynamic trajectory generation including wind tunnel values as a random walk between 50% and 100%
- Python source code to generate code
- Jupyter notebook example on python code usage

## Matlab
All the matlab code is contained in a single file, `lissajous.m`. The code is currently set up to generate angles for a drone experiment.
